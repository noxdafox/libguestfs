Upload a set of Yara rules from local file F<filename>.

Yara rules allow to categorize files based on textual or binary patterns
within their content.
See C<guestfs_yara_scan> to see how to scan files with the loaded rules.

Rules can be in binary format, as when compiled with yarac command, or
in source code format. In the latter case, the rules will be first
compiled and then loaded.

Rules in source code format cannot include external files. In such cases,
it is recommended to compile them first.
